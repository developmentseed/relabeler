## Relabeler
- Loads `classification.geojson` from Label Maker
- Shows labels over satellite imagery
- Allows GUI relabeling (save and convert back to `.npz`)
- Seems useful for correcting data errors prior to ML input

### Reasons to keep internal for now
- Don't want to release another library so quickly
- It's less notable
- Maintenance
- It slightly undercuts our point about OSM data being useful for ML

- Useful for Mark/Nana others? Should we self host or each person runs locally when needed? Electron app
